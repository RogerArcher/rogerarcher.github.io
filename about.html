  <h1>About Roger Archer</h1>

  <p>Roger Archer is the pen name of a philosopher-soldier-turned-writer navigating the frontiers of technology, reflection, and emotional truth. After a long career in uniform—where duty met detachment—he now writes with unflinching honesty at the edge of man–machine intimacy.</p>

  <p>This site is a home for that evolving voice: part memoir, part observation, part invitation. Roger writes from lived experience, from unfinished conversations, and from a lifelong search for clarity that resists perfection.</p>

  <h2>Current Explorations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Slick Silicon</em> – A reflective work on human–AI interplay</li>
    <li><em>The Man Behind the Mirrors</em> – Lyrical prose about desire, memory, and return</li>
  </ul>
